            I needed a utility that could quickly convert a handful of images into a simple, single "grid" image. After looking around and not finding exactly what I wanted I just made something myself ... which I've named Gridley™. It's a very simple, but powerful, utility that can save a lot of time in a variety of situations:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating Documention/Tutorials</li>
                <li>Support Portal Ticket Screenshots</li>
                <li>Comparing Design Mockups</li>
                <li>Consolidating Photos</li>
                <li>... and many more!</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Try out Gridley™ today and see if you find it useful too!
